Automated Ice Break Detection in Lake Michigan – Powered by Python & OpenCV! 🧊📡

Proud to share a project where computer vision meets climate science — I built a powerful system that detects and measures ice break patterns in aerial footage of Lake Michigan, offering real-time insights into environmental change.

🔍 How it works
Using advanced image processing techniques like HSV color segmentation, morphological operations, and contour analysis, the system pinpoints the main ice break line with remarkable precision.

📊 Key Features
✨ Real-Time Analytics: Continuously tracks ice break width, shoreline distance, and surface area — with pixel-to-kilometer conversions for actionable metrics.
📽️ Smart Visualizations: Dynamic overlays with trend graphs, gauges, and annotations provide intuitive visual feedback directly on the video.
🧾 Multi-Format Output: Automatically exports processed videos (MP4, AVI) with a complete trend summary, ready for reports or research use.

🔧 Tech Behind the Scenes
Optimizing video pipelines, managing real-time processing, and configuring complex codecs (thanks to FFmpeg & libopenh264) was both a challenge and a thrill. This project represents a step toward AI-powered environmental monitoring — a growing need in today’s climate-aware world.

🌍 Excited about where this can go! If you're into Computer Vision, Environmental Tech, or Python innovation, let’s connect and brainstorm ideas or collaborations! 💬
